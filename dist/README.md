# WatchGuard Endpoint Add-on for Splunk

The WatchGuard Endpoint Add-on for Splunk enables Splunk to collect and parse data from
WatchGuard EPDR and Panda AD360. This app normalizes Endpoint logs ingested from SIEM Feeder
into CIM-compliant datamodels for use with Splunk Enterprise Security and other Splunk Enterprise
apps. You can also consume this data using the separate WatchGuard Visibility App for Splunk.
